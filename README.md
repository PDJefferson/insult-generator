# Evil Insult generator website
The goal of this project is to get familiar with using apis to fetch data to
the website and libraries to facilitate the work.

# uses the following libraries/api:

popmotion - to animate the card component that holds the insults (with a focus on the spring animation)

bad-word - to filter out profane words

material ui - to leverage the css aspect of the website

https://evilinsult.com/ - api used to fetch the insults to the website

https://fast-dawn-89938.herokuapp.com/ -server used to set the cors headers and then fetch the results from the api
